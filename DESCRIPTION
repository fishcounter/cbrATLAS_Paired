Description: cbrATLAS is based on a stand-alone program provided by Columbia 
    Basin Research (University of Washington) to analyze active tag mark-
    recapture studies.  The use of an active tag increases subsequent detection 
    probabilities but relies on a signal that may fail due to battery or 
    equipment failure.  Without adjusting for this probability, estimated 
    survival will be under-estimated.  The survival adjustments rely on tag 
    failure data from a tag-life study using representative sample(s) of tags.  
    The adjustments to the survival estimates are conservative.
